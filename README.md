# Google-Books

## Summary

A react project to demonstrate grabbing and saving books from the google api.

## Technologies Used

React - Used to help render the code on to the DOM from multiple files usings components and props.

Mongoose - Mongoose acts as the database for this project by storing the users saved books.

## Future Development

This project is still a work in progress. At the moment, the current steps are to make sure Navbar links work and to have the searched up books render correctly on a card. These cards will have the title, author, a synopsis and an image of the book. Currently there is no connection between back end and front end as the appropriate properties have not been fully implemented.
